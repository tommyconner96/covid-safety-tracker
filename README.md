# COVID-19 Safety Tracker
With varying regulations by state and county, as well as inconsistent enforcement, it can be difficult to know how a public business handles COVID-19 procedures. The COVID-19 Safety Tracker seeks to solve this problem. Users may enter data about safety procedures by business. 
#### Is mask-wearing enforced?
#### Is contact tracing being done?
#### Is curbside service available?
#### Is indoor seating available?
#### Is outdoor seating available?
